# Last Will And Testament 
## Yaroslav Shirokov

I, Yaroslav Shirokov, of San Francisco, California, remove my former Wills and Codicils and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament.

### Payment of Debts and Expenses

Default on any debt that is possible.

### Everything else

Bury me with my money.

### My things

Drew Oliner, as my coolest fake father, should get _all_ my racing gear, and anything that goes fast including PCs.

Mike Skalnik, as my greatest fake father, should get my television, wearables, and all Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and any other cryptocurrency that I own.

Katy Shirokov, as the best sister I've ever had, should receive my book collection in its entirety, including any possible electronic copies, along with any remaining beer that I have left behind, and ops/dictator status to #a.

### Pull Requests
